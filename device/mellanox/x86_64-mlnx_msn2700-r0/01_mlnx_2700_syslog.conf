# This rsyslog configuration is intended to resolve the following error message that only appears on the MSN2700 platform:
# "ERR pmon#sensord: Error getting sensor data: dps460/#10: Can't read"
# This error is because of firmware issue with some type of PSU, we are not able to upgrade the FW online.
# Since there is no functional impact, this error log can be ignored safely.

if $programname contains "sensord" and $msg contains "Error getting sensor data: dps460/#" then stop
